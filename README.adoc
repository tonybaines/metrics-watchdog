-----
A histogram with an exponentially decaying reservoir produces quantiles which are
representative of (roughly) the last five minutes of data. It does so by using a
forward-decaying priority reservoir with an exponential weighting towards newer
data. Unlike the uniform reservoir, an exponentially decaying reservoir represents
recent data, allowing you to know very quickly if the distribution of the data
has changed. Timers use histograms with exponentially decaying reservoirs by default.

Tentative: use 50th percentile as the value to compare over time
may be useful to compare e.g. p50 and p999 - need to understand the maths
